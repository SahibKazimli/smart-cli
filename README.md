## Smart CLI
A modular, AI-enhanced command-line interface that provides code review, error explanation, system suggestions, and more, powered by Python RAG/Agent modules and Vertex AI.



## Project Goals

- Create a local-first, intelligent CLI that enhances standard terminal workflows.
- Provide AI-powered insights for code, system diagnostics, and command suggestions.
- Build a modular architecture that allows adding new skills/plugins easily.
- Showcase integration of Go CLI, Python AI modules, and cloud LLMs (Vertex AI).

## Current Development

- Project skeleton with Go CLI and Python RAG/Agent folder.
- Basic CLI command (code-review) calling a dummy Python skill.
- AI integration using LangChain + Vertex AI.
- Colored/progress-enhanced terminal output.
- Context/history tracking for smarter suggestions.
- Parallell chunk retrieval for performance

## Sidelined objectives for the time being
- Additional skills: error-explanation, system-check.
- Plugin system for modular skill addition.
