## Smart CLI
A modular, AI-enhanced command-line interface that provides code review, error explanation, system suggestions, and more, powered by RAG/Agent modules and Vertex AI.



## Project Goals

- Create an intelligent CLI that enhances standard terminal workflows.
- Provide AI-powered insights for code, system diagnostics, and command suggestions.
- Showcase integration of Go CLI, and cloud LLMs (Vertex AI).

## Current Development
- Repo scanning to enable LLM responses dynamically (works but a bit inconsistent)
- Concurrent index & reindexing of codebases
- Colored/progress-enhanced terminal output
- Context/history tracking for smarter suggestions

## Completed Objectives
- Parallel chunk retrieval and embedding for performance
- Basic CLI command (code-review, error-explanation)
- - AI integration using Vertex AI

## Sidelined objectives 
- Additional skills: system-check.
- Plugin system for modular skill addition.
- Python code is not going to be used, including skills.
- Routing internally based on user input, instead of creating tools (unsure, might do tools)
