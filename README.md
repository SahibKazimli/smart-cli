# Smart CLI
A modular, AI-enhanced command-line interface that provides code review, error explanation, system suggestions, and more, powered by RAG/Agent modules and Vertex AI.

# Project Status: On Pause
User experience features will be sidelined for the time being, but the project is atleast working on a system level. Obviously, I it will need some refinements but I want to explore some other projects. 

## Project Goals
- Create an intelligent CLI that enhances standard terminal workflows.
- Provide AI-powered insights for code, system diagnostics, and command suggestions.
- Showcase integration of Go CLI, and cloud LLMs (Vertex AI).


## Completed Objectives
- Parallel chunk retrieval and embedding for performance
- Basic CLI command (code-review, error-explanation)
- AI integration using Vertex AI
- Repo scanning to enable LLM responses dynamically 
- Concurrent index & reindexing of codebases 


## Sidelined objectives 
- Additional skills: system-check.
- Plugin system for modular skill addition.
- Python code is not going to be used, including skills.
- Context/history tracking for smarter suggestions
- Streaming for UX (will be implemented when I resume the project)

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Go
- **AI Integration:** Vertex AI, Gemini API
- **Core Concepts:** RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- **Concurrency:** Parallel embedding, retrieval, and indexing
